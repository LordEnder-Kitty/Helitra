# Helitra

Have you ever wanted the elytra to become a helicopter? No? Well, too bad.

This mod literally just makes it so that the elytra spins around like a propeller and makes helecopter noises.

This mod is pretty much entirely a joke post. Also, look in the mod menu config for a surprise (I literally spent more time making it than the actual functionality of the mod. I might have a problem. lol). Also, the config doesn't use any library, which I'm kinda proud of.

Also, there's a command to mess with the config if you want. Just type ``/helicopter`` to toggle the wings being a propeller. Type ``/helicopter helicopter`` to toggle the sounds. Type ``/helicopter helicopter helicopter`` to refresh the config. For instance, if you changed the actual file for whatever reason, instead of restarting the game for it to take effect, you can just type that command and it will load from the file.
